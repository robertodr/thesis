\epigraph{How does newness come into world? How is it born?

    Of what fusions, translations, conjoinings is it made?

    How does it survive, extreme and dangerous as it is? What compromises, what deals,
    what betrayals of its secret nature must it take to stave off the wrecking crew, the
    exterminating angel, the guillotine?

    Is birth always a fall?

    Do angels have wings? Can men fly?}{
