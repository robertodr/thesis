\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

It has not been one day, it's been four years.\footnotetext{
Just a perfect day \\
You made me forget myself \\
I thought I was \\
Someone else, someone good \\

--- \textsc{Lou Reed}}
And it's not always been perfect.
It is however true that the people I have met and interacted with during
this adventure have made me feel \emph{someone good}.
I don't feel it's an exaggeration to say that if I have made it this far
is also because of \emph{you}.
Thus, these few, poorly written lines are
a \emph{dedication} of this dissertation to you
and an \emph{acknowledgment}
of the patience and love you have shown towards me.
Thanks for not giving up on me.

First and foremost, \textitalian{ai miei genitori,
Adriano e Vilma. Ai miei fratelli, Francesca e Simone. A mia zia, Marina
ed ai miei nonni, Cherubino e Irma, Maria e Piero. Questo Ã¨ dedicato a
voi, per tutto quello che mi avete insegnato, per il sostegno continuo e
la pazienza infinita che dimostrate ogni giorno.}

in no particular order:\footnotetext{
And all of my friends were there, \\
