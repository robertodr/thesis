\begin{itemize}
    \item Something about exact state response theory: quasienergy,
      response functions, residues of response functions.~\autocite{}
    \item  Derivation of the linear response function with
      quantum/classical polarizable Hamiltonian and then refer to the
      OpenRSP paper for the open-ended treatment.~\autocite{pcm-openrsp}
\end{itemize}
